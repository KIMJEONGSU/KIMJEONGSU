After graduating from the Department of Computer Engineering, he has collaborated with various departments in the aviation industry and performed general duties with smooth communication skills.

Currently, I am challenging myself to become a data analyst through boot camp.

The most memorable project during the 7-month period is the Section project.

I think I learned the most by myself while proceeding from topic selection to planning using the contents I learned or new technology. Also, when various errors occurred, I learned how to solve them myself and share them with my motives to solve them together. I think these experiences will be of great help in developing the problem-solving and collaboration skills needed as a data analyst.

<h1>Intro</h1> 


### hello?👋

After graduating from the Department of Computer Engineering, I have been working as the general manager of the airport with my ability to communicate effectively while collaborating with various departments.

Currently, I am challenging myself to become a data analyst through boot camp.

The most memorable project during the 7 months was the team project.

I went from planning to implementation using the contents I learned or new technologies, and I think I learned the most by myself. In addition, when various errors occurred, I learned how to solve them myself and how to solve them together by sharing them with my motives. I think these experiences will be of great help in developing the problem-solving and collaboration skills needed as a data analyst.
